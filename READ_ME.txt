This is a private project made by z.es (https://discord.com/users/728711900841377832), read below on how to run.
	(The source code should automatically update when Zip-MultiTool.exe is ran)

If the tool isn't running:

   1). Run "Install-Node.cmd"

   3). Run "Install-Git.cmd"

   4). Run "Install-Packages.cmd" as a admin.

   5). If this still ins't working, install the packages manually (listed below in "Code")
       ). if it still doesn't work thats a skill issue.


How to set-up cookies / uid:

   1). Cookies and UID are editable inside of "zip-systems/src/Config.json"
